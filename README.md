# Mouse Injector for Dolphin 5.0 (11518)

* [dolphin-5.0-11518-mouse-injector.7z](https://github.com/carnivoroussociety/MouseInjectorDolphin/releases/download/v0.3/dolphin-5.0-11518-mouse-injector.7z)

A external app that injects cursor input into game memory, bundled with Dolphin emulator.

## Please Note
#### This is an unfinished, alpha prototype. Game support is poor beyond mouselook hooks.
I have no intentions of maintaining this software. Pull requests will be ignored.
